# Load Capacitor Value and Bulk (Body) Connection in CMOS Inverter

## Load Capacitor Value

- Default: **1 pF**
- Choose based on expected load:
  - 1 pF → light load
  - 5 pF → moderate load
  - 10 pF → heavy load
- Models the input capacitance of the next logic stage
- Only for simulation

---

## Bulk (Body) Connection

### PMOS
- Connect bulk to **VDD**
- Keeps source-bulk junction reverse-biased
- Prevents unwanted conduction

### NMOS
- Connect bulk to **VSS (ground)**
- Keeps source-bulk junction reverse-biased

## Notes on Power Rails

- Single-supply digital: VDD = positive, VSS = ground
- Dual-supply (analog): VDD = positive, VSS = negative (not used here)
- Reverse-bias ensures proper MOSFET operation

---

## Final Wiring

- Capacitor connected at inverter output
- PMOS bulk → VDD
- NMOS bulk → ground
- Circuit ready for simulation

## Summary

- Load capacitor models capacitive environment
- Capacitor value depends on next stage
- Bulk connections maintain correct MOSFET operation
- Wiring complete for simulation
