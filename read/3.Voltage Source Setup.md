# Voltage Source Setup for Simulation (Xschem / Schematic Design)

## Overview

Voltage sources in this schematic are added **only for simulation purposes**. They are not part of the fabricated IC, but are required to drive and test the circuit during simulation (DC sweep, transient analysis, etc.).

Two voltage sources are used:
- **VDD (power supply)**
- **Gate input signals**

These sources are selected from the **schematic (SKM) library**, not the PDK device library.

## Adding a Voltage Source

1. Open the component insertion menu.
2. Search for: **VSource**
3. Select the voltage source and place it in the schematic.
4. Duplicate it for multiple instances:
   - Click the component
   - Press **C** to copy
   - Place the duplicate

## Wiring vs Net Labels

Direct wiring is valid, but long wires can make the schematic messy. Instead:
1. Draw a short wire from the voltage source terminal.
2. Place a **net label** on that node.
3. Use the same net label name on other nodes that should be electrically connected.

## Setting the Voltage Value

Different fabrication processes have different supply voltages:

- **GlobalFoundries:** max VDD = 3.3 V  
- **SkyWater:** VDD = 1.8 V

Do not exceed the rated process voltage.

## Shortcuts

- Insert component: use search (`Vsource`)
- Copy component: press **C**
- Net labels: replace long wires for cleaner schematics

---

## Summary

- Voltage sources come from schematic library
- Two sources: VDD and gate input
- Net labels maintain clean schematic
- Set voltage according to process
- Components are only for simulation
