# CMOS Inverter Design Philosophy and Transistor Sizing

This document explains the design reasoning behind sizing transistors in a CMOS inverter when no strict written specifications are provided.

Even without hard specifications, the design should still follow correct theoretical and electrical principles so that the final result is a valid and functional CMOS inverter.

## 1. What Does a CMOS Designer Really Do?

In CMOS design, the main task of a designer is to **size the transistors**.

By sizing transistors correctly, you can control how the circuit behaves. If you want a MOSFET to conduct a certain amount of current, you simply use the MOSFET current equation, choose appropriate transistor dimensions (W/L ratio), and obtain the desired current behavior.

## 2. MOSFET Current Equation (Conceptual View)

The drain current equation depends on several parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **W/L** | Transistor sizing (width / length) |
| **μCox** | Transconductance parameter (mobility × oxide capacitance) |
| **VGS** | Gate-source voltage |
| **VT** | Threshold voltage |

Conceptually:

```
ID ∝ (W/L) · μCox · (VGS − VT)²
```

This shows that current depends on more than just transistor size.

## 3. What Can the Designer Control?

As a designer, you only directly control **two things**:

1. **W/L** — transistor size
2. **VGS** — gate voltage

All other parameters are determined by the **fabrication process (foundry)**. For example, if you are using the **Skywater PDK**, the following are all fixed by Skywater and embedded inside the SPICE models:

- Threshold voltage (VT)
- Mobility (μ)
- Oxide capacitance (Cox)

You do not manually enter these values — they are handled internally by the SPICE simulator.

## 4. Simplifying the Design Problem

For this design exercise, we ignore VGS and focus only on transistor sizing (W/L ratio). This leaves us with one main design variable: **transistor dimensions**.

---

## 5. Switching Voltage (VM)

A key parameter in CMOS inverter design is the **switching voltage**, denoted as **VM**.

From standard CMOS theory (e.g., Hodges & Jackson), VM depends on:

- Threshold voltages (VTN, VTP)
- Supply voltage (VDD)
- Transconductance parameters (KP, KN = μCox terms)
- Transistor sizing (W/L ratios)

VM is affected by both the electrical properties of the devices and their geometry (transistor sizes).

> **Note:** The original source referenced "Howen & Sodini." This appears to be a misspelling. The standard CMOS textbook references are *Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits* by **Hodges & Jackson**, or possibly *Microelectronic Circuits* by **Sedra & Smith**. Verify against your course materials.

## 6. Why VM is Important

The switching voltage determines the inverter's **noise margin**, **reliability**, and **digital correctness**.

Digital circuits work well because they are resistant to noise — but only if the inverter switches cleanly between logic 0 (low) and logic 1 (high). VM defines when the inverter transitions and how much noise can be tolerated without causing an error.

---

## 7. Noise Margin and Digital Reliability

The switching voltage VM directly impacts the **noise margin** by defining the boundary between what is interpreted as logic 0 and logic 1. A well-chosen VM ensures correct logic levels, stable digital operation, and immunity to small voltage disturbances.

This is why VM is a fundamental parameter in CMOS inverter design.

---

## 8. Relation to Device Physics

VM is influenced by carrier mobility, oxide capacitance, threshold voltages, supply voltage, and transistor sizing. These parameters come from semiconductor physics, fabrication technology, and the PDK (Skywater, GlobalFoundries, etc.).

This connects the full design chain:

```
Theory  →  Device Physics  →  Circuit Design  →  Simulation
```

## 9. Key Takeaways

| What | Who Controls It |
|------|-----------------|
| W/L ratio, Gate voltage (VGS) | Designer |
| Threshold voltage (VT), Mobility (μ), Oxide capacitance (Cox) | Foundry / PDK |

| Parameter | Determines |
|-----------|------------|
| Switching voltage (VM) | Noise margin, digital correctness, reliability |

Understanding theory helps explain **why** sizing matters and ensures the inverter operates correctly with good noise margins and reliable digital behavior.

## Summary

Even without fixed specifications, CMOS inverter design must follow correct theoretical principles. By focusing on transistor sizing and understanding switching voltage (VM), designers can produce an inverter that operates correctly with good noise margins and reliable digital behavior.

Knowledge of device physics, MOSFET equations, and CMOS theory is essential for practical IC design.
