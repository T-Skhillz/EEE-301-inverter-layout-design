# Xschem + SkyWater PDK: Voltage Sources and Grounds

When designing schematics in **Xschem** with the **SkyWater PDK**, it’s important to know which components are for **simulation only** and which are **fabricable**.

## Guidelines

- **Simulation-only components**  
  Components like **voltage sources** (`VSource`) and **grounds** are not fabricated. They are used only for simulations (transient, DC sweep, etc.).  
  These should be picked from the **Xschem library**:
  1. Press **Insert**.
  2. Search for `VSource` (or `GND` for ground).
  3. Place the component in the schematic.

- **Fabricable components**  
  Devices that will be part of the fabricated design (transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc.) must be picked from the **PDK library**.  
  Ask yourself:
  - Will this component be part of the GDS layout for fabrication?  
  - Is it inherently part of the device, or just for simulation?  
  If yes → pick from **PDK**. If no → pick from **Xschem**.

## Example

For a CMOS inverter:
- **PMOS and NMOS transistors** → PDK library (fabricable).  
- **Input voltage source (VSource)** → Xschem library (simulation only).  
- **Ground** → Xschem library (simulation only).

> Tip: Only components that are part of the fabricated device go in the PDK library. Anything purely for simulation comes from Xschem.
